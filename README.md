## [2022 Brazilian Elections](https://github.com/HecVini/DataVizProjects/blob/main/Brazilian2022Elections_DorlingCartogram/2022BrazilianElectionResults_DorlingCartogram.R)
In late 2022, Lula and Bolsonaro run for the Brazilian Presidency. Understanding the dynamics of votes in all 5570 Brazilian cities might be a challenging duty. But by grouping it by immediate regions, we can understand it better. Also, Dorling cartograms are a really useful tool to reduce the influence of large, but sparsely populated regions. Here there are some thoughts on it:

## [The Middle Passage, Vizualized](https://github.com/HecVini/TidyTuesday/blob/main/week25.R)
This chord diagram portrays one of the most tragic events in the history of mankind: the middle passage. In nearly 300 years, almost 10m enslave people crossed the Atlantic to the Americas. 30% of it went to Brazil, the other 60%, to the Caribbean, and the remaining 10%, to the US and Hispanic America. Chord Diagrams are excellent to show fluxes.

## The Burning Amazon
The rainforest is catching fire. After a steady decline in deforestation rates, devastation began to rise again in the last decade. But this time a bit different. Amazonas now has the second largest deforestation rate in the region - just after the longstanding leader Pará. For years, the problem was restrained to the states of Pará, Mato Grosso, and Rondônia. Now it is going north, and the Amazon is reaching the turning point.

## Do You Consider Yourself Rich?
Brazil is the land of inequality. The average income is about 7K USD (or 14k USD, adjusted by purchase power parity). But this income is badly distributed. If you are in a family with a monthly per capita household of 4 thousand BRL (or roughly 800 USD), you might be in the top 10% - and this level quickly goes down and we reach the poorest regions in the country.

## [Dog Breeds](https://github.com/HecVini/TidyTuesday/blob/main/week5.R)
This was my first ever TidtTuesdat challenge, back in early 2022. The default dataset was a ranking of dog breeds, according to the American Kennel Club methodology. So the question was: are the cuter and more funny dog breeds also harder to take care of? It seems to be.
